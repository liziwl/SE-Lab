     * A simple function that should return exactly the provided integer input.
     * <p>
     * The function below is expected to take in a value and return exactly the
     * same value. The manner in which the return value is calculated is
     * affected by three boolean values, but regardless of the boolean values
     * input, the function should already return the originally provided integer
     * value.
     * <p>
     * The implementation below has a bug, but the bug only manifests itself
     * under a specific set of inputs. The intent here is to demonstrate that
     * not all test coverage types are sufficient to find all bugs.
     *

     * @param cond2 the boolean that causes x to be decremented when true.
     * @param cond3 the boolean that causes x to be multiplied by 1 when true.
     * @return the original value of x.
